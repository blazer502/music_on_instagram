Music to Video Converter for Instagram by using MoviePy

## 1 Motivation
I just make it myself because [Audiogram](https://getaudiogram.com/) asked me to pay...

## 2 Goal
Create a pretty video converter for uploading music to instagram.


## 3 Design

### 3.1 Plan
I do not implement a pretty front end at first. After the core feautres has been implemented, I plan the development of the front end. I will make this project to work in a simple Web or Android environment. At first, the whole execution is regulated with a shell script

### 3.2 Feature
1) Convert music to a video with an image
2) Arrange the secion of the music
3) Show music waveform on the video
4) Edit the image including various font styles
